Introduction:
-The following script is used by the Data Mining group #4 from our Data Mining Class CS 5364. 
This script was done to utilize Text Mining resources in order to predict if a review is either true or fake. 
The methods employed were those of Lemmatization, Normalization, removal of Stopwords, removing punctuation, 
and finally using a Naive Bayes classifier to predict if it belongs to the True review dataset of the Fake review Dataset. 
In order to run the algorithm please provide a review that you have in mind and we will then compare it to the 
order on Amazon for shoes specifically. 
The algorithm can be performed for any type of review dataset but we focused on shoes which has approximately 2 million reviews at hand. 

Requirements:
-The requirements to run this program is the shoes review from Amazon and having saved it locally in your computer. 
After downloading the file please specify where in your machine the file is saved and tell the computer by updating the code marked as readfile. 

Installation:
-The whole project is done for python assembly specifically spyder using Python 3.7.
Please choose your Python 3.7 IDE of choice necessary to run this program. 

Configuration:
-There is no specific configuration necessary unless you do not have the permissions necessary to download and/or import any libraries in your choice of IDE. 

Troubleshooting & FAQ:
-If you encounter any problems please email us at pbustamantemurguia@miners.utep.edu or at aholguin13@miners.utep.edu with the error displayed. 
If you encounter any problems with any libraries please make sure that you are using Python 3.7 as there are some libraries that will not run with older versions of Python.
